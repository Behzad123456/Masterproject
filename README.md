# Masterproject: Frequency Estimation Using Deep Neural Networks
The sinusoidal signals are generated in Matlab as the following formula:
y(t) = Asin(2π f t + φ)
where A is amplitude, t is time, φ is phase and f is the frequency, which will be later found by our model for the test data. The values of the parameters are as following:
A = 1
1Hz ≤ f ≤ 20Hz
-90 ≤ φ ≤ 90
1000 samples from each generated wave in each f in 1s time steps was generated .The whole dataset was a 3620 × 1000 array.
